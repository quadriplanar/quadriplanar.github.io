These are the sql files from a project from the 3rd year databases class. The project was to create a smart fridge app to track the food inventory of a fridge, as well as recipes, requesting meals and ordering ingredients.
There is code to create the database, trigger and queries for the desired interactions, and to delete the database. 
The app was hosted on servers at the university engineering department, and we could access with a very simple java GUI on a windows computer
