[Here](https://quadriplanar.github.io/examples/terrain/percent/percentage%20gen.html) is a simple JavaScript terrain/map generator that uses a percentage slider to choose how much land there is. Since this uses Math.random, 100% fill will not actually be entirely land.

I plan on doing a series of more complicated and different style terrain generators. I think they are a good way to show different strategies in a visual way.
