Title: "Improved AI Heuristic Sliding Puzzle" Date: 2019-07-30

The app is [here](https://quadriplanar.github.io/examples/AI/SlidingPuzzle/SlidingPuzzle.html) and the repository is [here](https://github.com/quadriplanar/quadriplanar.github.io/tree/master/examples/AI/SlidingPuzzle)

This update fixes some bugs and add a new evaluation method: "Lazy Moves Remaining"

This method counts how many moves are left in a given state if any 2 adjacent tiles could be switched. It is quicker than trying to figure out exactly the number of moves, and gets a pretty good estimate of the which states are better. 

See the previous two methods discussed [here](https://quadriplanar.github.io/2019/07/23/AI-Sliding-Puzzle.html)

Also with the bug fixes, the previous next best method has much fewer moves than previously. Please see the details for 100 runs below
